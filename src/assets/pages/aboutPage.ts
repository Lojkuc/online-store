    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>The history of the company dates back to 2002. This project was organized by the Ivashchenko family, starting with a small production in Sevastopol. From 2002 to 2006, we worked only within the boundaries of our beloved hero city. However, since 2006, the Art Master company has undergone great changes, expanding the scope of its services and sales area. The latest European equipment was purchased, and we also began to use better and more expensive materials and fittings. To date, we have reached a fairly high level of output. We also work with many furniture factories and industries in the Crimea.</p>
